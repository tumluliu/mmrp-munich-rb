# Multimodal Route Planner for Munich

This web app is a demo to conceptually show multimodal optimal path finding. The urban area of Munich, Germany is selected as the experimental zone. This ruby on rails app is developed in 2010. The organization of the codes are not no neat. Besides, it depends on a multimodal shortest path library and a prepared multimodal graph dataset stored in Postgis. The multimodal shortest path library, a.k.a mmspa is also open-sourced on [Github](https://github.com/tumluliu/mmspa).

I am building a fresh new web app for multimodal route planning. So basically this RoR project is obsolete.
