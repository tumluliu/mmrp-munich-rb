        <p>I have to say that the overall performance is not so satisfying because the
            basic road network dataset is really large. And the main bottleneck is at
            the data loading process (execution of the SELECT operation). So please be patient after clicking the Calculate
            button. The basic usage of the app is listed as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Select the start/end points first by clicking the green/checkered flag
                first and then clicking on the map. The coordinates of clicking point will
                be displayed in the START and END text boxes. So far, the geocoding function
                is partly supported. Some of the addresses can be recognized according to my
                test. You can try inputting an address, and then clicking the flag button.
                If your inputted address becomes a coordinate, it works. Otherwise, it
                doesn't.  I strongly suggest identifying the START/END by clicking on the
                map directly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check some ROUTING OPTIONS as you like.
            </li>
            <li>
                Click the Calculate button.
            </li>
            <li>
                If everything goes OK, there should be some routing results listed
                below the Calculate button. Click on one of the items and the corresponding
                route will be shown on the map. Double clicking on one of them will center
                and zoom to the clicked path.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Any comments, questions, suggestions, criticism or complaints are welcome :)</p>
